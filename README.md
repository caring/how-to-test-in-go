# How to Test in Go

This is a simple tutorial to show how to write effective tests in go. The tests are designed to give a
quick framework to build tests for your needs. The first section will lay ground work for testing frameworks
such as assertions, table tests, and composing larger tests from smaller components. Future sections will cover
mocks, concurrent code, and benchmarks.

# How to run

The tests in this project can all be run using the standard go testing libraries. You should be able to checkout 
and run `go test ./...` to run all of the tests in the examples.
